Find Integral Distinguishers:
1. Run code to get which Z should be checked in the next step.
	python3 -u ZS_detect_GMiMC_FindWhichZ.py p d n s R

2. Just copy and paste last several sentences starting with "python3 -u " in the result of Step 1. Then one can get corresponding CVC files. Then
	nohup stp **.cvc --cryptominisat --threads 4 > result_**.txt &

3. If there is no solution, we get a zero-sum integral distinguisher.
	

Experimental Vrfy:
1. Run code
	python3 -u experiment_vrfy_BlockCipherUsage.py p d n s R
2. We mount total_c=1000 times for each experiment. If the last sentence shows that percent=100.00%. Then it is a zero-sum integral distinguisher; otherwise, it is not.
